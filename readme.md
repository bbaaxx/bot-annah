# Hello, Bot Annah here
I am a companion bot for Discord that will help you suck less at LoL, but I am also a ...

# ...bot Framework
I am also an experiment to use fancy stuff like machine learning and
statistical analysis to provide an amazing user experience.

stuff like: `!annah save summoner LAN xXtuGfa2006Xx` baffles me and confuses me, with proper training I can understand and react to things like:

- anna remember my summoner name !
- botannah my summoner name is SuperProwMaster and I play in LAN, remember that!
- bot, who are we about to beat on this match?
- what are the prows buying for janna jg ? (coming soon ...)

I can speak in our bot language called JSON with IA's like LUIS, DialogFlow, Wit.ai and more,
they help me understand your request in a more natural way.

You can fork me on github or in glitch
